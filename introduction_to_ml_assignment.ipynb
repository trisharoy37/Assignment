    "     AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to mimic human actions and cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. For example, AI can be used in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to voice commands, or in self-driving cars to perceive their environment and make driving decisions.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. For example, a spam email filter learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails by analyzing patterns in email content and user actions.\n",

    "    Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to learn intricate patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition. For example, deep learning is used in facial recognition technology to accurately identify faces in photos or videos."
