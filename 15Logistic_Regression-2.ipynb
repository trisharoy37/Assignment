    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Grid Search CV:\n",
    "- Exhaustive Search: It explores all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined grid.   \n",
    "- Systematic Evaluation: It evaluates each combination using cross-validation.   \n",
    "- Guaranteed to find the best (within the grid): If the optimal hyperparameters are within the defined grid, Grid Search CV is guaranteed to find them.   \n",
    "- Computationally Expensive: It can be very time-consuming, especially with a large number of hyperparameters or a wide range of values.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "- Random Sampling: It samples a fixed number of hyperparameter combinations randomly from specified distributions.   \n",
    "- Probabilistic Search: It does not evaluate all combinations, but explores a random subset of the search space.   \n",
    "- Faster than Grid Search: It is generally much faster, especially for high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.   \n",
    "- May not find the absolute best: It may miss the optimal hyperparameters if they are not included in the random samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Grid Search CV when:\n",
    "- You have a relatively small number of hyperparameters to tune.\n",
    "- You have a good idea of the range of values for each hyperparameter.\n",
    "- Computational resources are not a major constraint.\n",
    "- You need to find the absolute best hyperparameters within the defined grid.\n",

    "Choose Randomized Search CV when:\n",

    "- You have a wide range of possible values for each hyperparameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Data leakage in machine learing occurs when information from outside the training dataset is unintentionally used during the model training process. This leads to overly optimistic performance estimates and poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine you're building a model to predict customer churn. You use a feature like \"days since last purchase\" in your training data. However, if some customers in the training set have already churned, thier \"days since last purchase\" will be artificially high. This information leaks future behaviour into the training data, leading to an unrealistic advantage for the model."

Perform preprocessing steps (like scaling) separately on each set to prevent information from leaking between them. Also, be mindful of feature engineering to avoid creating features that use information from the future."
