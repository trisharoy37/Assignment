    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The core difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting lies in the underlying infrastructure and how resources are allocated:   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Web Hosting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Server Dependency: Your website resides on a single physical server. This server has a fixed amount of resources (CPU, RAM, storage).   \n",
    "- Resource Limitations: If your website experiences a surge in traffic, the single server might become overloaded, leading to slow loading times or even downtime. Scaling resources often requires manual intervention or migrating to a more powerful server.   \n",
    "- Location Dependency: The server is located in a specific physical location. This can impact website loading speeds for users who are geographically distant from the server.   \n",
    "- Maintenance Responsibility: You (or your hosting provider) are often responsible for server maintenance, including hardware upgrades, software updates, and security patching.   \n",
    "- Cost Structure: Typically involves fixed monthly or annual fees, regardless of actual resource usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Hosting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network of Virtual Servers: Your website is hosted on a network of interconnected virtual servers. Resources are pulled from this network, providing greater flexibility and redundancy.   \n",
    "- Scalability and Elasticity: Resources can be scaled up or down on demand, automatically or manually, to handle traffic fluctuations. This ensures consistent performance even during peak times.   \n",
    "- Redundancy and Reliability: Data is often mirrored across multiple servers, minimizing the risk of data loss due to hardware failures. If one server goes down, others can take over seamlessly.   \n",
    "- Global Reach: Cloud providers have data centers around the world. You can choose to host your website in multiple locations to improve loading speeds for users globally.   \n",
    "- Managed Infrastructure: The cloud provider handles most of the infrastructure management, including hardware maintenance, security, and updates.   \n",
    "- Cost Structure: Often uses a pay-as-you-go model, where you only pay for the resources you consume.   \n"
