    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- MSE directly measures the average squared difference between actual house prices and predicted prices.\n",
    "- It penalizes larger errors more, which is crucial when predicting house prices because even small deviations can have a significant financial impact.\n",
    "- It provides a quantitative measure of prediction error in the same units as the target variable (squared price values), making it useful for optimizing the model."

    "**Q3. You have a dataset with a significant number of outliers and are trying to select an appropriate regression metric to use with your SVM model. Which metric would be the most appropriate in this scenario?**\n",
    "Ans: MAE\n",
    "- Less sensitive to outliers: Unlike Mean Squared Error (MSE), which squares the errors and disproportionately penalizes large deviations, MAE treats all errors equally.\n",
    "- Robust against extreme values: Since house prices often have extreme variations (e.g., luxury homes vs. standard homes), MAE provides a more balanced assessment of error.\n",
    "- Easy to interpret: MAE directly represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices, making it straightforward to understand."
