    "Ans: While R-squared is a useful metric to assess the goodness-of-fit of a regression model, it has a limitation: it tends to increase as more independent variables are added to the model, even if those variables are not statistically significant. This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and performs poorly on new data.\n",

    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Regularized linear models are a powerful tool to prevent overfitting in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from assigning large weights to the features. This penalty term helps to simplify the model and reduce its variance, making it more robust to noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Polynomial Regression\n",
    "Consider a simple example of polynomial regression. Let's say we have a dataset with a single feature(x) and a target variable(y). We can fit a polynomial of degree n to this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x² + ... + βₙxⁿ\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose a very high degree for the polynomial, the model can fit the training data perfectly, but it may also capture noise and outliers in the data. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting, we can use regularization. For example, we can use Ridge regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss = MSE + λ * Σβ²\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, λ is the regularization parameter, which controls the strength of the penalty. By increasing λ, we can force the model to have smaller coefficients, which reduces the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting."
